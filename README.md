All Objects are for an Oracle Database and SQL*Plus environment.

The objects are defined without a schema and will reside in the schema's default tablespace. Ensure that the schema has permission to create objects in that tablespace and that it has sufficient quota assigned.

use the following files in order

  install.sql file to create the objects
  load.sql file    to load the db with data
  test.sql file    to run some tests
  report.sql       to pull the reports
